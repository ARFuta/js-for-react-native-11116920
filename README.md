I've made 2 files: arraymanipulation.js, and userinfo.js
arraymanipulation.js has 2 functions: processArray, which takes an array of numbers as an argument and returns a new array where each even number is squared and each odd number is tripled, and formatArrayStrings, which takes 2 arrays as arguments, and modifies each string based on its corresponding number by capitalizing the entire string if the number is even and converting the string to lowercase if the number is odd.

userinfo.js has a function, createUserProfiles ,that takes an array of names and the array of modified names from arraymanipulation.js.returns an array of objects, each containing originalName, modifiedName, and id (auto-incremented starting from 1).
